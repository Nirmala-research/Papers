# **Abstract**
  In recent years, skin cancer diagnosis has been aided by the most sophisticated and advanced machine learning algorithms, primarily implemented in the spatial domain. In this research work, we concentrated on two crucial phases of a computer-aided diagnosis system: (i) image enhancement through enhanced median filtering algorithms based on the range method, fuzzy relational method, and similarity coefficient, and (ii) wavelet decomposition using DB4, Symlet, RBIO, and extracting seven unique entropy features and eight statistical features from the segmented image. The extracted features were then normalized and provided for classification based on supervised and deep-learning algorithms. The proposed system is comprised of enhanced filtering algorithms, Normalized Otsuâ€™s Segmentation, and wavelet-based entropy. Statistical feature extraction led to a classification accuracy of 93.6%, 0.71% higher than the spatial domain-based classification. With better classification accuracy, the proposed system will assist clinicians and dermatology specialists in identifying skin cancer early in its stages.
